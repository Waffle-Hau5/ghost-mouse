ATM just a function for automatic somewhat humanlike mouse movement for games (OSRS to be specific) message me let me know if you have any notes, improvements, ideas or want to work with me!
Could be a very lucrative venture if we sell the GP on forums. 
Currently the function takes steps and moves in curves and variated paths, it will also pause movement randomely to seem human.
